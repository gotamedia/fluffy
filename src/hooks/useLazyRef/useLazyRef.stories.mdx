## About
useLazyRef is a helper hook that replaces useRef which allows you create a ref object with initial value with a callback that being called and initiated once.

useRef does accept an initial value but it will never be used or re-assigned and it will be created on each time the Component re-renders
This will reserve a place in memory and it will wait to be garbage collected.

useLazyRef stands out from useRef when your initial value is an new Instance or some sort of a new Class that has some logics in it's constructor.

## Usage

<Source
    language={'tsx'}
    code={`
import { useLazyRef } from '@gotamedia/fluffy'
\nconst Component = () => {
    const mapRef = useLazyRef(() => new Map())
}
`}
/>
