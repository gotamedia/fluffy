## Peer dependencies
Fluffy requires that you install following depdencies in your own project
```

```

## Usage
```TSX
import { Icon, Icons } from '@gotamedia/fluffy'

const MyComponent = () => (
    <div>
        <Icon icon={Icons.Info}/>
    </div>
)
```

const App = () => (
    <div>
        <Paper>
            {`It's so themeable! üë©‚Äçüé§`}
        </Paper>
    </div>
)

render((
    <ThemeProvider theme={getTheme()}>
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
), document.getElementById('root'))
```

## Develop in fluffy
Fluffy uses Storybook to present it's components, each component should have a *.stories.tsx in it's root dir in order to show it in Storybook
```TSX
import React from 'react'
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react'

import MyComponent from './index'
import * as Types from './types'

export default {
    title: 'Components/MyComponent',
    component: MyComponent,
    argTypes: {
    },
} as Meta<typeof MyComponent>

const Template: Story<Types.MyComponentProps & {
    text: string
}> = (props) => {

    return (
        <MyComponent>
            {props.text}
        </MyComponent>
    )
}

export const Basic = Template.bind({})
Basic.args = {
    text: 'My fluffy component'
}
```

To see your component run:
```bash
npm run storybook
```

It will open a new tab in your browser with all the component stories on the left sidebar
